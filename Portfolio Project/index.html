            I have recently picked up learning HTML from scratch all over again.
            I have a very basic understanding of it from studying it back in
            2018 for a short time. I am sharpening my HTML skills, and trying to
            gain an advanced understanding of it in order to work with Emperial
            Tech.

            Similarly, as with HTML, I have picked up CSS from scratch all over
            again. I have a very basic understanding of it from studying it back
            in 2018 for a short time. I've learned while studying web
            development that it is hard to work with only HTML. CSS makes for a
            much prettier website.

            I've worked with GitHub while I was in college. I had to use it
            while I built an Operating System in my final course. I also used
            GitHub in a few other courses while in school. I now use GitHub to
            store my web development projects on both Emperial Tech's Git, and
            my own personal Git.
